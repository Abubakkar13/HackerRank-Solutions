#BUBBLE SORT

It is one of the most commonly asked question at every IT based company's technical interview. 

To start with, following is the complexity of Bubble Sorting technique:

*Worst-case Space Complexity: Auxiliary.

*Best-case Performance: О(n) comparisons, О(1) swaps.

*Worst-case Performance: О(n2) comparisons, О(n2) swaps.

*Average Performance: О(n2) comparisons, О(n2) swaps.

##SORTING PROCESS

Following steps are followed for Bubble Sort:

1. Bubble Sort starts with unsorted array.

2. First 2 elements are compared and if
    (a) First element is lesser than or equal to the second element, no change is required.
    (b) First element is greater than the second element, the two numbers are swapped.
    
3. The consecutive elements are compared till the end of array is reached and rule for swapping is used as per step 2.

4. A loop is used for 0 to N-2 number of times for iteration process. So, Step numbers 2 to 3 are iterated for a total of N-1 times.

5. Finally, we get the sorted array.

In addition to Bubble Sort, we have following Sorting Techniques too:
1. Selection Sorting.
2. Insertion Sorting.
3. Merge Sorting.
4. Heap Sorting.
5. Quick Sorting.
6. Radix Sorting.
7. Counting Sorting.
8. Bucket Sorting.
9. Shell Sorting.
